# Many Rubrics

By <b>Angelica Harris</b>, <b>Brandon Li</b>, <b>Sam McGarey</b>, and <b>Zach McMillen</b>

Our project is a Java Command Line Application which allows teachers and students to automatically generate final grades for classes given a student's grades in each assignment. Our project allows teachers to have multiple rubrics for a class, and takes a student's best grade based on each of the rubrics.

## Iteration 1

### What user stories were completed this iteration?
- A student should be able to keep track of their score on each assignment
- A teacher should be able to copy a past rubric
- A teacher should be able to edit a past rubric

### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
- A teacher can produce grades for different classes
- A student should be able to test what grade they will receive in a class by putting in their scores
- A teacher should be able to get a file with their students' final grades

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
- User input through the command line is partially implemented but doesn't full work yet

### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line?
- Since our user input through the command line isn't fully functioning yet, our project can't currently run. We are looking to have this working by Iteration 2. The best way to test our code is to run our unit tests.
