# Many Rubrics

By Angelica Harris, Brandon Li, Sam McGarey, and Zach McMillen

Our project is a Java Command Line Application which allows teachers and students to automatically generate final grades for classes given a student's grades in each assignment. Our project allows teachers to have multiple rubrics for a class, and takes a student's best grade based on each of the rubrics.

1. Completed Stories
    A student should be able to keep track of their score on each assignment
    A teacher should be able to copy a past rubric
    A teacher should be able to edit a past rubric
    Group rubrics togethe
    Calculate max grade among grouped rubrics

2. Stories For Next Iteration
    A teacher should be able to create new assignments
    A teacher should be able to create multiple rubrics for 1 class
    A teacher should be able to get a file with their students' grades
    A teacher can produce grades for different classes
    A student should be able to test what grade they will get in a class by putting in their scores
