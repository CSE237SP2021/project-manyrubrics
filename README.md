# Many Rubrics

By <b>Angelica Harris</b>, <b>Brandon Li</b>, <b>Sam McGarey</b>, and <b>Zach McMillen</b>

Our project is a Java Command Line Application which allows teachers and students to automatically generate final grades for classes given a student's grades in each assignment. Our project allows teachers to have multiple rubrics for a class, and takes a student's best grade based on each of the rubrics.

## Iteration 1

### What user stories were completed this iteration?
- A student should be able to keep track of their score on each assignment
- A teacher should be able to copy a past rubric
- A teacher should be able to edit a past rubric

### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
- A teacher can produce grades for different classes
- A student should be able to test what grade they will receive in a class by putting in their scores
- A teacher should be able to get a file with their students' final grades

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
- User input through the command line is partially implemented but doesn't full work yet

### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line?
- Since our user input through the command line isn't fully functioning yet, our project can't currently run. We are looking to have this working by Iteration 2. The best way to test our code is to run our unit tests.

## Iteration 3

### What user stories were completed this iteration?
-A user can rank the students by their grades


### What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
-N/A

### Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
- edge cases could have been added to make the UI more effective

### What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line?
- To run the program, right click on the "DriverTest.java", select "Run As" -> select "Run Configuarations" -> set "Arguments"-> set program arguments inside of textbox to "-m -m"-> press apply and close. Next, go to the top green run arrow at the top of your eclipse, select the drop down black arrow -> click "Driver"JClass. The program will start in your console.   

-to run "11.RankStudents". Step 1, type '1' , this creates 1 assignment. Two, type '2' to create multiple students. Three, type '3' add an assignment to your rubric (that you completed in step 1). Finally, type '11' and type in the rubric that you created in step 3. 


What user stories were completed this iteration?
-#42: a user can rank students based on their grades

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
-N/A
