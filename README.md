# Many Rubrics

By Angelica Harris, Brandon Li, Sam McGarey, and Zach McMillen

Our project is a Java Command Line Application which allows teachers and students to automatically generate final grades for classes given a student's grades in each assignment. Our project allows teachers to have multiple rubrics for a class, and takes a student's best grade based on each of the rubrics.
